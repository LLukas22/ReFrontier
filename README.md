# ReFrontier.TranslationTransfer

A tool to transfer translation from a translated community patch `mhfdat.bin` file into a original japanese `mhfdat.bin` file. Without copying the altered recepies for weapons/armor.

Usage: `ReFrontier.TranslationTransfer.exe [Path/to/CommunityPatch-mhfdat.bin] [Path/to/japanese-mhfdat.bin]`

⚠️ If you play on a community server the keyquest infos also have too be copied into the japanese file. Currently only parsing the Keyquest-Info is implemented. The other code was lost to time and since im not playing anymore i wont rewrite it.
